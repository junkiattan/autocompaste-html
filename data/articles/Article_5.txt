What is bandwidth? Width of the band of frequencies between the half power points

What is barrier potential? The natural difference of potential that exists across a forward biased pn junction.

What is base biasing? A method of biasing a BJT in which the bias voltage is supplied to the base by means of a resistor.

What is battery? A DC voltage source containing two or more cells that convert chemical energy to electrical energy.

What is binary? A base 2 number system

What is bipolar junction transistor? It is an active semiconductor device formed by two P-N junctions whose function is amplification of an electric current. Bipolar transistors are made from 3 sections of semiconductor material (alternating P-type and N-type), with 2 resulting P-N junctions.

What is bistable multivibrator? A multi vibrator with two stable states. An external signal is required to change the output from one state to the other. Also called a latch.
