What is absorption? Loss or dissipation of energy as it travels through a medium. Example: radio waves lose some of their energy as they travel through that atmosphere.

What is acceptor atoms? Trivalent atoms that accept free electrons from pentavalent atoms.

What is AC coupling? Circuit that passes an AC signal while blocking a DC voltage.

What is AC/DC? They are equipment that will operate on either an AC or DC power source.

What is AC generator? Device to transform mechanical energy into AC electrical power

What is AC load line? The ac load line is a graph that represents all possible combinations of and for a given amplifier. Under normal circumstances, the ac and dc load lines for a given amplifier are not identical.

What is AC power supply? Power supply that delivers an AC voltage

What is active component? A component that changes the amplitude of a signal between input and output.

What is active filter? A filter that uses an amplifier in addition to reactive components to pass or reject selected frequencies.

What is active region? The region of BJT operation between saturation and cut off used for linear amplification.
