CS4249 Assignment 1

General
- For all the pages, the links to other pages have been removed, to prevent users from accidentally clicking and resetting the data and affecting any test results. E.g. If you are currently viewing Instructions, the "Instructions" tab will be active, however you would not be able to click and go to any other tabs. The only exception is for the pre-questionnaire, where the tab linked back to the index page has been left open. This is in case the participant accidentally keyed in the wrong Participant ID in the welcome page. In that case, he/she can then retract back and re-key in the correct Participant ID
- For both the practice sessions as well as the experiment blcoks, the stimuli has been changed to questions instead of the desired text. This is because if we had not change it, it would have been difficult to simulate the case for ACP where the participant does not have any prior knowledge of the content given that we must still somehow tell the particpant what to copy over. In response, for both the practice experiment data as well as the actual experiment data, an answer field has been included. Instead of the stimuli being compared for accuracy as well as being highlighted, it will be the answer that is being compared for accuracy and also being highlighted when necessary.

Pre-questionnaire
- Form validation has been added such that all fields are required before the participant moves on. Questions have been design with the goal that we want to reflect a good representative samples of the target population which is University students. We also inquired their prior experience with each technique to gauge how proficient they are. The proficiency is to help us understand the difference in usage between novices and experts and their improvement later. We also looked at their faculties and majors because we wanted to make sure to get a good balance of people from multiple faculties and different majors in order to properly represent the university students.

Instruction

- Detailed instructions has been added, with pictures.

Practice session

- practice data and 2 articles have been independently coded in order to allow the participant to familiarise with AutoComPaste as well as to refresh on the normal Copy-Paste technique if necessary.
- the practice data and articles reinforces what the instruction mentioned in order to solidyfy understanding of the instruction prior to the actual experiment blocks.
- Also the simulation of the various conditions, e.g. how we simulate knowledge of content at that instant, have been also included into the practice session so as to familiarise the experiment process with the participant. However it has been made sure that the practice data is different from the experiement data used in the actual blocks.

Experiment

- Each block has 36 trials as indicated in the experiment design documents.
- To simulate the condition that a participant knows the content at the instant of copying, the window containing the desired text will focus in front, plus the desired text will be highlighted. To simulate the no prior knowledge, the answer to the question would not be highlighted, meaning the participant would have to search for teh correct answer.

Post-questionnarie

To find out the usability and get the participant feedback on what they think about the performance between the 2 techniques, and to also ask them about the pain points of any of the technique they use.
