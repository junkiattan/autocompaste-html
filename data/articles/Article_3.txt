What is ampere? Unit of electrical current

What is amplifier? A circuit that increases the voltage, current, or power of a signal.

What is amplitude? Magnitude or size of a signal voltage or current.

What is analog? Information represented as continuously varying voltage or current rather than in discrete levels. This is as opposed to digital data varying between two discrete levels.

What is anode? The positive electrode or terminal of a device. The "P" material of a diode.

What is antenna, receiving? A device that converts a radiated electromagnetic wave into an electrical wave.

What is apparent power? The combination of reactive power and true power is called apparent power, and it is the product of a circuit's voltage and current, without reference to phase angle. Apparent power is measured in the unit of Volt-Amps (VA) and is symbolized by the capital letter S.

What is armature? Rotating or moving component of a magnetic circuit

What is armstrong oscillator? An oscillator that uses an isolation transformer to achieve positive feedback from output to input.
